# Open Source Safety Driving Environment Models

Here are published models of the driving environment for public viewing, comments and collaboration.

For now, as the primary model developer, Leon Starr is playing the role of 'benevolent dictactor' on this project to keep the models coherent and consistent, so we aren't yet accepting pull requests.

If you have comments please either contact us via email or create an issue (see tab above) and we'll take a look.

This is a new project and we are a small team, so your patience is appreciated while we get this thing booted up!
