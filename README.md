# Open Source Safety: Driving Environment Reference Models

Here are published models of the driving environment for public viewing, comments and collaboration.

This is a work in progress, and we will be making a lot of edits, especially to our [wiki](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/opensafety-mbse/wiki) in the coming weeks. The wiki is probably the best place to start browsing to make sense of our models.

We will be uploading a variety of new subsystems and driving maneuvers, especially with regard to intersections in the first half of 2022.

If you have comments, please post a [discussion](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/opensafety-mbse/discussions) topic, create an [issue](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/opensafety-mbse/issues), or send us an email and we'll take a look.

This is a new project and we are a small team, so your patience is appreciated while we get this beast booted up!
